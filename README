## What is this?

This is a Shiny app to track the number of patients that failed to have surgery in the UK due to Covid-19 -related reasons.

## How it works?

This app contains four key elements:
1. Model that estimates the cancellations in function of the Covid rate: this is based on the literature modelling
2. Component that interacts with UK data sources: contacting [coronavirus.data.gov.uk](coronavirus.data.gov.uk) when it is estimated to have an update (week days after 4 pm)
3. Internal data storage: system to keep track of initially projected values and updates with new estimates (respecting API limits).
4. Shiny visualisation: built in R, computes the values and presents them in a [web interface](https://gkoutoslab.bham.ac.uk/covidtracker_surgery/).

## Development notes

Elective activity file needs to be last day of month! Rather than Excel dec 2021 as 01/12/2021, it needs to be dec 2021 as 31/12/2021. Also save the file as csv and plug it in!
In case this is used beyond 2022 it might be necessary to update holidays and other values.

Check that the script is executing in the right folder.
